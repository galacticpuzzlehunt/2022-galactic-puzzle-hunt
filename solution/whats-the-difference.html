<p>We may notice the &ldquo;big things&rdquo; are provided in alphabetical order (implying that we need to re-sort) and that the &ldquo;small things&rdquo; are one letter off from a different image&rsquo;s &ldquo;big thing&rdquo;. We can therefore reorder these items in a cycle.</p>
<p>Reading out the letters from the &ldquo;small things&rdquo; that are different from the &ldquo;big thing&rdquo; letters gives the answer: <strong>MORE POPULAR THAN JESUS</strong>.</p>

<p>Now for the second part of this puzzle, we need to download the image files. One way to realize this is that inbox emoji are present next to the download link, and it is worded in a way that calls attention.</p>
<p>Putting the image files in the extraction order from the first part, and reading the filenames, gives the message CONSIDER EXIF METADATA.</p>

    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>This puzzle was partially written on a Caltrain ride from San Francisco to Mountain View. Jenna outlined the
idea to CJ in a slightly quieter voice than usual, while gesturing at the Google Sheets app on her phone saying things
like &ldquo;this cluephrase&rdquo; or &ldquo;this answer&rdquo; and fervently hoping no one within earshot who planned
to do GPH was paying attention.</p>
